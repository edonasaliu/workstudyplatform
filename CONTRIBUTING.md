## Contributing to Minerva Workstudy Platform

We welcome contributions from the community and are pleased to have you join us in developing this platform. Whether it's fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, all contributions are appreciated.

### How to Contribute

If you're ready to contribute, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This will give you a personal copy where you can make changes without affecting the original project.

2. **Create a Branch:**
   Within your fork, create a branch for your contribution. This isolates your changes and makes it easier to merge them later. Use a clear branch name like `feature/add-job-filtering` or `bugfix/login-issue`.

3. **Commit Your Changes:**
   Make your changes in your branch and commit them. Write clear, concise commit messages that explain your changes.

4. **Write and Run Tests:**
   If you're adding new functionality, write tests that cover your changes. Run the existing tests to ensure you haven't introduced any regressions.

5. **Open a Pull Request:**
   Once your changes are complete, open a pull request to the main repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes and reference any related issues.

6. **Code Review:**
   The manager of this project, Edona Saliu, will review your pull request. Be open to discussion and be prepared to make revisions if requested. 

### Reporting Issues/Bugs

If you find a bug or an issue, report it! Here's how:

1. **Check Existing Issues:**
   Before submitting a new issue, check to see if it has already been reported. If it has, you can add to the existing discussion.

2. **Use the Template:**
   When creating a new issue, fill out the issue template with as much detail as possible. Include steps to reproduce the bug and any other relevant information.
