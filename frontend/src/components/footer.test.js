/**
 * footer.test.js
 * 
 * This file contains tests for the FooterComponent. The FooterComponent is tested to ensure 
 * it renders all the expected sections including company information, quick links, candidate 
 * and employer sections, support links, and social media icons. These tests verify that the 
 * static content and the dynamic content (like the current year) are present and correctly 
 * displayed. This helps in ensuring that the footer maintains its structure and functionality 
 * throughout changes in the application.
