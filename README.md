# Work-Study Platform

Welcome to the Work-Study Platform repository, the all-in-one solution to streamline Minerva University's work-study programs.

## üéØ Description

### Problem Statement

At Minerva University, the current decentralized system for managing work-study programs poses a set of challenges:

- **Inefficiency**: Students navigate through various communication channels (primarily email, Telegram, and Notion) to find and apply to work-study opportunities, which is time-consuming and can lead to missed opportunities and miscommunications. 
- **Lack of Transparency**: Limited information on work-study positions and requirements hinders informed decision-making, on part of both managers and students. Students report issues of not understanding 1) what positions exist/are open, 2) deadlines, 3) requirements for various positions, 4) managers for various positions, and 5) feeling like their talents aren't considered in the work study allocation process. Managers report frustration that they don't receive students particularly interested in a given position (unless they personally recruit such a student). 
- **Administrative Burden**: Minerva work-study administrators grapple with aquiring/sharing relevant  information for various positions and managing student applications. In the current state, if a student is not "chosen" specifically by a manager, students are randomly assigned to open positions, as there is no system for students to indicate position preferences.
