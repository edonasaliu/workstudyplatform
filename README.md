# Work-Study Platform

Welcome to the Work-Study Platform repository, the all-in-one solution to streamline Minerva University's work-study programs.

## üéØ Description

### Problem Statement
At Minerva University, the current decentralized system for managing work-study programs poses challenges of inefficiency, lack of transparency, and administrative burden. Students struggle to find and apply for opportunities, while managers and administrators face difficulties in managing the program.

### Key Features
The Work-Study Platform addresses these problems by providing the following key features:

1. Student Dashboard: Provides students with a streamlined interface to view job postings, apply to positions, and log their work hours.
2. Manager Dashboard: Enables managers to post job opportunities, review student applications, and monitor assigned tasks.
3. Admin Dashboard: Allows administrators to oversee the entire work-study program, including managing work-study teams, student data, and generating detailed reports.
4. WA Position Tracker: A centralized feature that enables administrators to upload and manage detailed data about students and their work-study roles.
5. Login/Register Authentication: The platform provides a secure registration and login system with role-based access controls for students, managers, and administrators.
